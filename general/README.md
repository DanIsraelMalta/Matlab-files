* runFunc.m - implements a general moving window inlined scalar function upon a given vector
* corrAlign.m - align two numeric vectors such that their inner product (correlation) is maximal
* linDependent.m - finds linearly dependent columns in a given matrix

               (zero padded if necessary)
* logSpan.m - logarithmically grid's a given 1D region with required number of points
* space.m - spacially distibuted grid of a given 1D region, relative to its edges or center.
